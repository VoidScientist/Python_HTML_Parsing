# HTML Parser:

This is a group project for ESME's algorithm course.

## What the program should achieve:

1.	Analysing input HTML code, identifying tags, attributes and their structure.
2.	Reporting structural errors such as incorrectly closed tags, missing tags, etc.
3.	Providing a clear and understandable error report, indicating the exact locations of errors in the source code.

## Methodology :

We will use test-driven development so that our code is simple and doesn't break down too much on unforeseen cases.

## Roles:

### Louis ARCELON (Helmsman):

- In charge of keeping tracks of the process, along with distributing task and managing the repo.

### Raphaël KERVAON:
- He doesn't understand.

### Théo VOREAUX:
- Test case analysis (Wikipédia).

### Rémi PICHOT (Spokesperson):

- Explain everything at the end.
